# Unisports
## Applying HCI knowledge by creating an app prototype

### Embarking on the Unisports project has been a profound learning experience, navigating through the realms of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to develop an app that truly addresses the needs of our university's student community. Here's a glimpse into the enriching journey and lessons learned throughout the process:

**Key Learnings**:

- **User Insights**: Conducted interviews to identify student pain points, laying the foundation for an empathetic design.

- **User Personas**: Crafted detailed personas to understand diverse user needs, ensuring inclusivity in Unisports' design.

- **Affinity Diagram**: Mapped and prioritized insights collaboratively, streamlining our approach to problem-solving.

- **User Flow Diagram**: Visualized seamless interactions, guiding users from facility discovery to feedback submission.

- **Information Architecture**: Structured intuitive navigation, enhancing the user experience in locating and booking facilities.

- **Wireframes**: Developed skeletal outlines to iterate and refine the UI elements and layout of Unisports.

- **Figma Prototyping**: Transformed wireframes into an interactive V1.0 prototype, embodying HCI principles in design.

- **Usability Testing**: Engaged seven volunteers to gather real-world insights, refining the app based on user feedback.

Unisports isn't just an app; it's a testament to HCI's power in creating an accessible, engaging, and user-friendly campus recreation experience.
